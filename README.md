# A-PEDESTRIAN-DETECTION-SYSTEM-WITH-A-SINGLE-OPTICAL-CAMERA

To run this code, you are supposed to run train_svm_q.m to train the SVM Classifier.

Images in Out_File are pedestrian images.

Images in Out_File_n are non-pedestrian images.

Then you can run processing_video.m to get the result.

And I also upload the result video file, myfile3_test3.avi, so that the result of this project can be viewed directly.
